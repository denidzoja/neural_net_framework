Neural net framework - Classification

How to test model:

1. Clone this repo
2. Ensure you have numpy and opencv-python installed in your python environment (virtualenv or global python interpreter)
3. Execute fashion_mnist.py to train a model on the fashion mnist dataset for classification
4. Optional weight/biases are provided in the /solved directory to be used as a starting point for further training. (see fashion_mnist_preprocess.py for an example how this is done)
