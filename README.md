**Neural net framework - Classification**

How to test model:

1. Clone this repo
2. Ensure you have numpy and opencv-python installed in your python environment (virtualenv or global python interpreter)
3. Execute fashion_mnist.py to train a model on the fashion mnist dataset for classification
4. Optional weight/biases which are already trained are provided in the /solved directory to be used as a starting point for further training. (see fashion_mnist_preprocess.py for an example how this is done)

Trained data accuracy:
/solved/fashion_mnist_rough -> 0.897 train, 0.873 validation
/solved/fashion_mnist_accurate -> 0.910 train, 0.880 validation
